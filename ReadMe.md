**Datavoidant**

A new type of political disinformation targeting underrepresented populations, e.g., the Latinx community, has been on the rise. Such
disinformation has been weaponizing the limited information (data voids) that exists about political topics and certain underrepresented
communities to promote political lies. The novel nature of such disinformation has made it difficult for researchers to counter. In
this paper, we present a system to identify and address political data voids within underrepresented communities. Armed with an
interview study indicating that independent news media has the potential of addressing these data voids, we designed the intelligent
system: Datavoidant. Datavoidant introduces a novel design space that focuses on providing independent journalists with a collective
understanding of data voids to then facilitate generating content to cover the voids. We performed a user interface evaluation with
independent news media journalists (N=22). Journalists reported that Datavoidantâ€™s features allowed them to more rapidly and easily
have a sense of what was taking place in the information ecosystem to address data voids; they also reported feeling more confident
about the content they created and the unique perspectives they proposed to cover the voids.We finish by discussing how Datavoidant
enables a new design space where individuals can collaboratively make sense of their information ecosystem, and can proactively
devise strategies for uniquely contributing information to their ecosystem to prevent disinformation together
